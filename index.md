## Basic Course Components

<a id="b:lec"></a>
<h3>Lecture</h3>  Expect class to be interactive; you'll work through problems in groups, compare multiple approaches to solutions, and answer multiple-choice questions using iClickers (see <a href="#p:engage">Engagement</a> below). Due to space constraints, you must attend the lecture in which you're enrolled.

<a id="b:disc"></a>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
There are two kinds of discussion section: in Supplemental Instruction you will work in small groups, practicing course content with extra exercises and activities; TA review sessions will demo tools and answer questions about the programming assignment specifications.  You can attend any discussion section(s) you like; attending discussion section counts towards your <a href="#p:engage">Engagement</a> with the class.

<h3>Lab Sessions</h3>

You must attend the lab session in which you are enrolled.  You will work in groups in lab;
you are starting your journey into Computer Science and we want
to help you meet your classmates who will be with you along the way.
The groups will be assigned by the Lab TA and group
assignments may
change from week to week. All labs must be finished
in the allotted class time.  As a group, you will create a lab report each week and your TA will review
it and give you feedback.

<iframe style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid gray border-spacing: 2px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSEpVCIZbTA-wmlchM2BRYR_fCeCKu8cqFY9kYd3K5tBJLSVuF0sFFT_DwoQ0Ysxxi7o5RSFlpKVoV7/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;chrome=false" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>


<a id="pa"></a>
<h2>Programming</h2>


Learn by doing!  Most weeks, you will be working on a programming assignment for this class.
You will feel the intense excitement of seeing your work come alive through the computer, and
also the equally intense frustration of wading through error messages and tricky bugs.  Both of these
are at the heart of what it means to be a computer scientist.  The programming assignments are designed
to invite your creativity, problem solving skills, tenacity, and interests. When you find yourself stuck
during your work on a programming assignment, ask for help:

* <a href="#staff">Open lab hours</a>

* <a href="#staff">Instructor and TA</a> office hours

* <a href="#pa:help">Private questions to instructors</a> on the class discussion board on <a href="https://piazza.com/" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.


Remember to always read the programming assignment description carefully.  Some programming assignments will
be <a href="#pa:pa-collab">**pair-programming**</a> assignments, where you are expected to develop the algorithm and code in close collaboration
with a partner; others will be <a href="#pa:pa-collab">**individual**</a> assignments, where you will gain confidence with your own mastery
of the material.

PA0 counts towards 2% of your overall course grade, the rest of the assignments (PA1 through PA8) each count towards 5%
of your overall course grade.


<a id="pa:help"></a>
<h3>Getting help</h3>

<h4>Working and getting help in the lab</h4>

You have <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php" target="_blank">computer accounts</a> for the labs in the CSE building.  Even if you choose to work on your programming assignments on
your own computer, you can work in these labs. The type of programming assignment you are working on will determine whether you can <a href="#pa:pa-collab">collaborate with other students</a> in the lab.

During <a href="#staff">open lab hours</a>, tutors, TAs, and the
instructors will be available to help. We will work with you to get you un-stuck when you're not sure what to do next on an
assignment. We will be using the <a href="https://autograder.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Autograder</a> system to manage to queue of
requests for help in lab.  To get in the queue, log into Autograder with your @ucsd.edu email and submit your question as a ticket:

- Give a meaningful question or problem statement in your ticket.
- Be prepared! When the tutor shows up, you should be ready to reproduce the issue you're having, have a test case that doesn't produce the right output, show them a drawing of the situation you're confused about, etc.

Expect to have about 5 minutes with a tutor (or TA or instructor): you probably won't have the solution at the end of the conversation, but you should feel un-stuck and ready to try new approaches.

<a id="pa:piazzahelp"></a>
<h4>Asking & Answering questions on Piazza</h4>

Piazza is an online discussion board where we can make announcements and students can ask questions. Both we (the course staff) and your classmates can answer your questions. There are two kinds of questions you should ask on Piazza:

- Private questions about programming assignments or your grade / account
- Public questions about the content of lecture, discussion, lab, and any readings

For each assignment, you will find a Frequently Asked Questions post, where we will answer all common questions we receive in office hours and via (private) Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post, we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new important questions and answers come in.

When answering questions, be polite, be clear, and assume the best intentions of the person asking. If it turns out you make a
mistake or were wrong, admit it with a smile (emoji are great for this 😊), and make sure the correct information is clear.
Above all, keep in mind that the course is a community whose goal is to foster a positive learning environment for everyone.
For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official! They could be downright wrong or misleading,
completely by accident. “My classmate said so on Piazza” is not a legitimate justification in most arguments, though they may
indeed lead you in helpful directions.


<a name="pa:code-mentor"></a>
<h3>Code Mentoring</h3>

Programming and computer science are cumulative topics, where later concepts
build heavily on earlier ones. In addition, the process of revision is
important in programming. To that end, we offer code mentoring sessions to
students whose programming assignments get low scores.

On each programming assignment, if you get less than 70% of the points, we
will contact you to schedule a one-on-one _code mentoring_ session with a
staff member. Partners on pair programming assignments will be contacted
individually.

In a code mentoring session, you'll sit down with the assigned staff member
for 30 minute meeting. In the meeting, you'll review where your assignment
lost credit, and work through several of the necessary fixes. If you attend
the session and do the work, your score will be increased to 70%. These are
positive, supportive meetings whose goal is to help students who might have a
few misconceptions or have made a few mistakes to not fall behind in the
course.


<a name="pa:pa-collab"></a>
<h3>Collaboration and Sources</h3>

Programming assignments will be clearly labelled as **individual** or
**pair** assignments. These each come with responsibilities for how you
complete the work.

<a id="p:individual-ai"></a>
For **individual** assignments, you should complete all the work on your own,
with help only from the course staff and course resources. You can ask
private questions on Piazza, look up reference material (e.g. the Java
documentation, a Google search), and refer to previous assignments as much as
you like. However, you shouldn't talk about the assignment's content with
others, look at anyone else's code for the assignment, look at anyone else's
screen while they're working on the assignment, or copy ideas from code you
find on the internet. The academic integrity agreement you will sign along
with your first assignment will spell out these rules in detail.

When working on **pair** PAs, you must use the “Pair Programming” approach.
In pair programming, two programmers share one computer. One student is the
“driver,” who controls the keyboard and mouse. The other is the “navigator,”
who observes, asks questions, suggests solutions, and thinks about slightly
longer-term strategies. The two programmers switch roles frequently (you
decide, but anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour is reasonable). Working in
pairs should make you much better at programming than working alone would.
The resulting work of pair programming nearly always outshines that of the
solitary programmer, with pairs producing better code in less time.

“[Pair programming] makes learning programming faster and more fun. I have
had previous experience working both alone and with partners. I definitely
agree that working with partners is more profitable.” – CS student

To "learn the do’s and don'ts" of pair programming and to see pairs in
action, view this entertaining video about pair programming from North
Carolina State University: [An Introduction to Pair Programming Version
2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_U12uqRhE). However, the most important
rule of pair programming is that you must work together, co-located, on the
same part of the assignment at the same time. Splitting up the work on a PA
is considered cheating.

You will choose your own partner. You may choose any partner from your lab
section. E.g. if you are in the 9am Tuesday lab section in B230, you must
work with another student from that section. The pairings for PA1 will be organized
in lab in the first week.

You will need to arrange times to meet outside of class. We expect you will
need around 5 hours on each pair PA to work with your partner. We expect
everyone to be flexible and professional in arranging those times as
necessary; if your schedule is highly constrained, explore possible meeting
times with your prospective partner before you commit to the partnership.
You may choose a new partner for each pair PA, or you may decide to stay with
your current partner.

<a id="pa:best-practice"></a>
<b>Best Practices</b> There are some best practices for pair programming:

- You must always be physically located with your partner when developing code.
- You may not do any coding, including documentation, without your partner
present. You may not use or even look at any code you have previously
developed without your partner. This means, if you choose to split with a
partner, you must both start over from scratch with your new partner.
Completely throw your old code away.
- You and your partner must both be active
contributors to the code. This mean, you must both be engaged in the
development (talking, typing, suggesting, etc) and you must switch roles
regularly.
-  You may not split the code and develop it separately, even if you
are sitting right next to each other. You must collaboratively develop a
single solution.



<b>Choosing a partner</b> You should try to pick a partner whose
experience and skill level with programming is similar to your own. This may
not always be possible and it is sometimes hard to compare skill levels, but
students tell us (and other data support) that pairs are most productive when
the partners start at about the same level.

Still, people often pair up with another whose skills are different. This is
somewhat unavoidable, as no two people have an identical skill set. The
differences may be great or small, but this is exactly like most real-world
working situations. Part of accomplishing a task is to get the most out of
each member and make each member stronger and more productive on subsequent
tasks.

Students bring different strengths to the process, regardless of how much
experience they have had with programming. Both experienced and inexperienced
students will need to draw on their reasoning and problem solving skills. A
more experienced partner may sometimes feel frustrated or slowed down by a
less experienced partner, but the experienced partner still benefits from the
teamwork in many ways. The less experienced partner’s requests for
clarification often uncover flaws in an approach or solution; the exercise of
providing a clear explanation solidifies and deepens the explainer’s own
understanding and the teamwork and communication skills they gain have great
value in both the academic realm and the job market.

“My partner had never coded anything before so I was able to teach him a
little bit about how it worked. The teaching bit helped me a lot with
understanding the labs and passing the exams.” – CS student

The less experienced partner may feel that questions hold the other partner
back or that there is no benefit to participating actively, but pair
programming studies show that paired work is consistently better than work
the stronger partner does alone. It is each partner’s job to understand the
whole task; that means asking questions when necessary and answering them
when possible.

It may be instructive to read a selection of students’ partner evaluation
comments from similar courses that have used pair programming; they give a
picture of what good partnerships are like (and a few disasters, too). Read
[Pair Programming
Evaluations](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/evalcomments.html)
from the University of California, Irvine Bren School of Information and
Computer Sciences.


<b>Dealing with Differences</b> If you believe your partner is not
participating appropriately in pair programming (e.g., she or he does not
keep in touch, does not come prepared to work on the assignment, or does not
seem to be engaged in the process) please first address your concerns to your
partner, and try to agree on what should be done to make the pair programming
experience work well for both of you. If that approach is not successful,
explain the issues to your teaching assistant or the instructor, who will
work with you and your partner to improve the situation.

If your partner drops the course or otherwise stops participating, you should
MUTUALLY AGREE TO SPLIT FOR THE REST OF THE ASSIGNMENT and you must EACH FIND
A NEW PARTNER, STARTING OVER FROM SCRATCH, as described above. You should
never simply abandon your partner without an agreement from your partner that
this is the best course of action. If you are having trouble, please see the
instructor ASAP.

<b>How Pair Programming Affects Your Grade</b>
You and your partner will receive the same score on your code.

<b>When in Doubt, Seek Clarification</b>
Pair programming is shown to help, not hinder, your successful completion of the introductory course. It is important that you
understand the processes and expectations up front so you can gain the most benefit. If you are unsure of any of the aspects
of pair programming and how it is implemented in the course, see your instructor right away.



<a id="policies"></a>
## Policies

<a name="p:community"></a>
<h3>The CSE 8A Community</h3>
CSE 8A is a large course: there are over 35 people on the instructional team and over 600 students.  We are all here because we are excited about Computer Science and want to ensure a productive, interesting, and useful quarter.

At UC San Diego, we agree to hold ourselves to the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a> of respect, inclusion, and integrity.  This translates to all our interactions in this course, and beyond.

These practices go beyond the university setting. A huge amount of modern computer science happens via collaboration, in text, online. Sites like Stack Overflow and Github hold incredible wealths of information generated through asking and answering questions. Computer science research, large system development, and cutting-edge design happens through professional, high-volume mailing lists. Practicing using Piazza professionally prepares you for these situations, so do it mindfully.


Before you post a question or answer, consider:

- Does it contribute to a positive, constructive, and respectful forum for discussion and learning?
- <a id="p:piazza-ai"></a>Does it contain contain source code from your solution or other information that shouldn't be shared class-wide?
- Is it a question that's been asked before, that you could find via searching?

If you make a post that violates these guidelines, we may make it private and remind you of these guidelines. Overall, our goal is to make the public content on Piazza constructive and relevant for everyone.


<a name="p:engage"></a>
<h3>Engagement</h3>

We highly recommend actively participating in class, attending discussion, and completing the weekly review quizzes. Regularly
engaging with the class in these ways counts towards the Engagement component of your overall score.

This score is calculated on a weekly basis (starting in Week 1).  The maximum number of points you can earn in one week is 6.
The lowest weekly participation score will be dropped when calculating your overall engagement average.

Earn engagement points by:
* __In class participation via iClickers__  In Weeks 1 through 10 (starting with the second lecture of the quarter), you will
earn credit for attending and participating in lecture (2 points each) and discussion section (1 point each, up to a maximum
of 2 points per week).
Clicker questions will be graded for participation only and not for correctness of the response.
Full credit for clicker points for a given day will be
awarded for clicking in at least 80/% of the time that day. Forgetting your clicker counts as missing a class, so please
remember to bring it!
 We have you
respond to problems in lecture because there’s quite a bit of evidence that
sitting and listening passively [probably isn’t the best way to
teach or learn
science](https://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963). <a id="p:clicker-ai"></a>
 _Do not attempt to falsify iClicker or discussion participation or review quiz submissions; this would be considered a violation of academic integrity._

* __Weekly (P)review quiz__ Online quizzes review the week's material and preview some upcoming examples each week. You can
submit your answers to each quiz as many times as you like. The latest submission before 11pm on Monday will count towards
your engagement score. Each weekly review quiz will be worth 6 points.  Review quizzes will stay available even after the
deadline; in the past, students have found working through them to be helpful when studying for exams.
<a id="p:quiz-ai"></a>
_The review quiz must be completed independently and individually. You may refer to your class notes and resources linked from
this website,
but not to other references. You may not share information about the review quiz with others, take the review quiz in someone
else's name, or ask anyone for prior knowledge about the review quiz._


We encourage you to find your preferred method for staying engaged with the course.  There are lots of ways to earn
full credit for a week's engagement.  For example: (1) attending all lectures (for the section in which you're enrolled); or
(2) attending two lectures and two discussion sections; or (3) answering all questions on the review quiz correctly; or (4)
attending two lectures and getting two answers correct on the review  quiz; etc.


<a name="p:exams"></a>
<h3>Exams</h3>

There will be three total exams in the course: two during the quarter (also
called “midterms”) and a final exam. The midterms will be in the evening during
the quarter. They will primarily contain content from the weeks leading up to
them. Since the programming content is cumulative, the second exam will
necessarily contain content from the first exam, as well.

<a id="p:exam-ai"></a>
Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you
must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your
own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the
exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations).
You may not speak to any other student in the exam room while the exam is in
progress (including after you hand in your own exam).  You may not share any
information about the exam with any student who has not yet taken it (including
students in future quarters of CSE8A).


The first two exams will each be worth 8% of your final grade. The final exam
will be worth 24% of your final grade. The final exam will have a specific
structure – it will be broken into three parts corresponding to material from
the first exam, the second exam, and the remainder of the course. Your grade
for each midterm will be the *maximum* of the midterm grade and the score you
get on the corresponding part of the final exam.

For example, if you get 50% of the points for midterm 1 and 100% of the points
for midterm 2, and then score a 75% on part 1 of the final, 25% on part 2, and
100% on part 3, you would get:

- MAX(0.5, 0.75) * 8 = 6 points for midterm 1 (0.75 was higher, so the final
  increased the midterm score!)
- MAX(1, 0.25) * 8 = 8 points for midterm 2 (0.25 was lower, so the original
  midterm score was used)
- 0.75 * 8 + 0.25 * 8 + 1 * 0.8 = 16 points for the final exam (the score on
  the final exam is the same regardless of how the midterms went)
- A total of 30 out of 40 exam points towards your final grade

This policy also covers what happens if you miss a midterm for any reason. If
you are absent for a midterm, you get a 0 initially, and then whatever score
you get on the final for that section will be applied to your midterm grade.
There are no make-up midterms, and the final exam policy is governed by the
[university's
policies](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/).


<a id="p:grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>

Your grade will be computed from:

<ul>
  <li>42% programming assignments (2% for PA0, 5% for each of PA1 through PA8)</li>
  <li>40% exams (8% each for two midterms, 24% for a final exam)</li>
  <li>10% lab work (completed in lab each week)</li>
  <li>10% engagement</li>
</ul>

Yes, this adds up to 102% .

After your weighted average is calculated, letter grades will be assigned
based on the following grading scale:

<table class="table table-striped">

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall class performance), but we guarantee that we will
not adjust the scale to make it harder to get a better grade.
In addition, you must pass the final exam in order to pass the course.

<b>Late and Makeup Work</b> In general, work cannot be handed in late for
credit. We will drop the lowest weekly engagement and lab score to account
for personal events and constraints that make you miss those deadlines.

Programming work cannot be handed in late, with one exception. The last
programming assignment will synthesize many of the topics seen throughout the
course. As such, it will demonstrate your understanding of many other parts
of the course, and to reflect this, the score on the final programming
assignment can <em>replace</em> an earlier PA score. In addition, you can
hand in the final programming assignment by Monday, 11:59pm during finals
week (which will be after its deadline in week 10) for a 20% deduction.

<b>Regrades</b> Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix to your grade
(announced along with the release of grades), with a clear argument for why a
mistake was made. If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade
you were initially given is final. All regrades should be made through
Gradescope's interface.

<b>Switching into CSE8A</b> If you're considering joining CSE8A after the quarter
begins, we want to make sure you are on track to doing well.  To that end, noone will
be able to add CSE8A after the end of Friday of Week 1.  If you enroll in the class
after Tuesday of Week 1, you will have an automatic extension on PA0 and will hand it in
on the same day you hand in PA1.

The Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) provides assistance to students, faculty, and staff
regarding reports of bias, harassment, and discrimination. OPHD is the UC San Diego Title IX office. Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions that are recipients of
federal funds. All students have the right to an educational environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.

Students have options for reporting incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment. Sexual violence includes sexual
assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Information about reporting options may be obtained at OPHD at
(858) 534-8298, ophd@ucsd.edu or <a href="http://ophd.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://ophd.ucsd.edu</a>. Students may receive confidential assistance at CARE at the Sexual
Assault Resource Center at (858) 534-5793, sarc@ucsd.edu or <a href="http://care.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://care.ucsd.edu</a> or Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at (858) 534-3755 or <a href="http://caps.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://caps.ucsd.edu</a>.

Students may feel more comfortable discussing their particular concern with a trusted employee. This may be a student affairs
staff member, a department Chair, a faculty member or other University official. These individuals have an obligation to
report incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment to OPHD. This does not necessarily mean that a formal complaint will
be filed.

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help.


### Students with Disabilities

We aim to create an environment in which all students can succeed in this course.  
If you have a disability, please contact the
<a href="https://disabilities.ucsd.edu/about/index.html" target="_blank">
Office for Students with Disability (OSD)</a>,
which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall, to discuss appropriate accommodations
